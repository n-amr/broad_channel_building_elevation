**Project Overview**

- This exploration projects maps the elevation above sea-level (in feet) of each house in Broad Channel and their vulnerability to flooding.

- It will serve as a baseline for including potential data/animations in a current documentary I'm producing about Broad Channel, that addresses flooding, climate change and resiliency

- The benchmark for flooding is the occurence of 'regular' tidal flooding by 2050, which corresponds to a mean higher-high water level (currently 6ft) + 21".

- We chose tidal flooding because tides have been the main cause of floods in Broad Channel, with less frequent (but sometimes more extreme) occurences from storms and rain

- The objective is to understand what % of homes are under threat from regular flooding, and to map these houses

**Elevation Data**
- Elevation based on an NYC open data dataset provided by the department of building (DOB) in October 2022

- We assume that most buildings / houses in the city haven't changed since 2022 so consider that the dataset is fresh enough

- The DOB used a third party provider to create the dataset, through the use of LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology to create the dataset

- More info on the dataset provided here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Building-Elevation-and-Subgrade-BES-/bsin-59hv/about_data

**Outcomes**
- A  notebook to process and analyse the house elevation data in Broad Channel
- A simple map that plots each house based on whether they will be regularly impacted by flood by 2050
